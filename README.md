# Advent of Code
My solutions for <a href="http://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>

Hacky, googly, using a shoddy knowledge of Python and 2nd year Software Engineering student programming skills. Enjoy.

1: Iterate and count    
2: Iterate and calculate    
3: Iterate and count, 3-2 uses a toggle    
4: Brute force until match    
5: Regex matching    
6: 2D array of lights and an awful lot of string.split()    
7: Dumb bubble-sort-like iterations - repeat instructions until it's impossible that any wire is unconnected.    
8: Initially I just used find/replace, but that felt bad so I replicated it using sed    
9: Modified Kruskal's, limiting results to paths instead of trees    
10: Python letter-counting (slow a.f.)    
11: Functions for next() and valid() - simple programming    
12: python's built-in JSONDecoder.decode(), then a bunch of recursion    
13: Permutations. Feels bad, but permutations.    
14: Simulation, because it's more fun that way (turns out it was necessary)    
15: Permutations. This one doesn't feel as bad to permute.    
16: Simple dict storage, then matching.
