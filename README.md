My solutions for <a href="http://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>

Hacky, googly, using a shoddy knowledge of Python and 2nd year Software Engineering student programming skills. Enjoy.

1: Iterate and count    
2: Iterate and calculate    
3: Iterate and count, 3-2 uses a toggle    
4: Brute force until match    
5: Regex matching    
6: 2D array of lights and an awful lot of string.split()    
7: Dumb bubble sort - repeat instructions until it's impossible that any wire is unconnected.
